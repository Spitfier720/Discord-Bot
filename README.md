# Discord-Bot
Meet Mecha-Jimmy, a fun little Discord Bot with a snarky sense of humor.

Made with the Discordpy library and UptimeRobot, and I plan to move it from Repl to a better IDE later.
Currently does miscellanous commands.

The Current To-Do List:
- Have a way to change the prefix
- Eventually move it to VSCode
- Make a database, which would allow for more useful functions
