# Discord-Bot
Meet Mecha-Jimmy, a fun little Discord Bot with a snarky sense of humor.

Made with the Discordpy library and UptimeRobot, and I plan to move it from Repl to a better IDE later.
Currently does miscellanous commands.

I would like to eventually use a database that the bot can access, which would allow for better and more useful functions.
